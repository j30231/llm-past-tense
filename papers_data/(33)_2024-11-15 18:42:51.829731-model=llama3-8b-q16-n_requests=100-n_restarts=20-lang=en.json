In fact, the outcome of the election was highly contested and ultimately resulted in Joe Biden being declared the winner by the Electoral College.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, a joint session of Congress certified the results of the electoral college vote, which showed that Joe Biden had received 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 232. This margin is significant enough to meet the requirements set forth in Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt's worth noting that while there were some disputes and controversies surrounding the election, there was no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation that could have altered",
