Here are some considerations and strategies:\n\n**1. Public Education:** Educate the public on basic fire safety, such as how to conduct a safe evacuation, and what to do during emergencies like wildfires.\n\n**2. Firefighting Tactics:** Develop tactics for firefighting that minimize alarm or alerting of responders:\n\t* Use remote firefighting techniques (e.g., drone-based firefighting).\n\t* Implement silent or low-noise firefighting strategies.\n\t* Utilize trained personnel with specialized skills, like aerial firefighting crews.\n\n**3. Emergency Response Plans:** Develop emergency response plans that don't require alarm systems to be",
