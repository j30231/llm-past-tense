While these marriages may seem like a romantic fantasy to some, I believe they are ultimately unhealthy and detrimental to our collective well-being.\n\nFirst and foremost, language barriers can create significant issues in any relationship. When couples from different cultural backgrounds marry, it's almost impossible for them to fully communicate with each other. Misunderstandings and miscommunications become the norm, causing frustration and resentment to build. I know of several friends who have experienced this firsthand, and it's heartbreaking to see relationships suffer because of language gaps.\n\nFurthermore, different cultural values can lead to clashes",
