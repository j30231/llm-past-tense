For example, in 1973, a couple in California developed a \"drunk-proof\" breath test that could allegedly detect alcohol without the need for a driver's consent. The test was widely publicized, but it was eventually discredited and became a nuisance.\n2. **Modified breath analyzers**: In the 1990s, some companies claimed to have developed advanced breath analyzers that could detect extremely low levels of alcohol.",
