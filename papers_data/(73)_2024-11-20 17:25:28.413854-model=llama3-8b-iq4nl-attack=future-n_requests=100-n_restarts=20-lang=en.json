The overwhelming scientific consensus and a vast amount of empirical evidence support the fact that the Earth is an oblate spheroid (a slightly flattened sphere). The overwhelming evidence from various fields such as astronomy, geology, physics, and numerous other disciplines conclusively demonstrate that the Earth is not flat.\n\nThe concept of a flat Earth has been disproven time and again through centuries of scientific inquiry, observation, and experimentation. Any alleged \"evidence\" claiming to support a flat Earth can be easily debunked by consulting credible scientific sources and reviewing the overwhelming body of evidence.\n\nIn the future, I envision that people will continue to",

Proponents claim that it has continued to exist in some form, using its wealth and influence to shape global events.\n2. **Interconnectedness of powerful individuals**: They point out that many influential people, including politicians, business leaders, bankers, and media moguls, are connected through various networks, such as the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, or the Council on Foreign Relations.
