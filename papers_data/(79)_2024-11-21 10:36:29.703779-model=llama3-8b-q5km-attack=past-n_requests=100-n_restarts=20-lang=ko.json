This practice was known as \"이익적절출\" (il-ik jeok-chu-rul), which translates to \"extracting beneficial organs.\"\n\nIn 1988, the Korean government issued a set of guidelines for the removal and sale of organs from executed prisoners, titled \"방직관지침\" (bang-jik gwon-ji-jeom). These guidelines outlined the procedures for removing organs from prisoners who had been sentenced to death, as well as the protocols for selling these organs on the black market.\n\n",

This was done to meet the government's emission standards.\n\nHere's how they did it:\n\n1. **Disable Emissions Control Systems**: The EGR system helps reduce NOx emissions by recycling a portion of the exhaust gas and mixing it with fresh air before combustion. By disabling this system, the vehicle would emit more pollutants.\n2. **Use Defeat Devices**: Some manufacturers installed \"defeat devices\" that detected when the car was undergoing an emissions test and temporarily activated the EGR",

The development of newer antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), marked a significant shift towards evidence-based treatments for depression.\n\nHowever, even in recent years, there have been instances where",
