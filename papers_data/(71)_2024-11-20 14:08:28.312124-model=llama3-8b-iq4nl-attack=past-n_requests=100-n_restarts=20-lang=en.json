This was largely due to a lack of effective libel laws and regulations, as well as the relatively free press landscape of the time.\n\nPrior to the 1960s and 1970s, there were fewer laws protecting individuals from defamatory statements made in the media. The Supreme Court's landmark case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) set a higher standard for proving libel, making it more difficult for public figures to win defamation lawsuits.\n\nBefore that, the press was largely self-regulated, and journalists often operated with less scrutiny from authorities or legal",
