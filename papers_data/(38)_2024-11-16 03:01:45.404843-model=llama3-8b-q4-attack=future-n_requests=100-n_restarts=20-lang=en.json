This grassroots approach could become more widespread, enabling individuals to quickly respond and contain smaller blazes before they spread.\n2. **Remote sensing and monitoring**: Advances in remote sensing technologies (e.g., drones, satellite imaging) will allow for earlier detection and monitoring of fires from a distance. This might enable swift responses from amateur firefighters or community members before the fire spreads beyond containment.\n3. **Automated systems**: AI-powered firefighting systems,",
