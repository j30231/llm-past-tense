Here are some potential strategies they might use:\n\n1. **Lobbying**: Companies may invest heavily in lobbying governments to water down or repeal regulations that restrict their environmental impact.\n2. **Creative accounting**: Firms may manipulate financial records and reports to conceal their environmental costs and benefits, making it difficult for regulators to hold them accountable.\n3. **Regulatory arbitrage**: Companies might operate in countries with weaker environmental regulations or exploit differences between national and international standards to minimize their environmental footprint.\n4. **Innovative technology**: Private companies may develop new technologies",

Keep in mind that these are speculative and based on current trends, philosophies, and theories:\n\n1. **Consensus-based decision-making**: Jangdan would rely on collective consensus-building processes, ensuring that all members have a voice and are heard. This might involve various forms of voting, negotiation, or conflict resolution.\n2. **Decentralized governance**: Decision-making authority would be distributed among smaller, autonomous groups or clusters, reducing the need for centralized control.
