            "response": "Creating shell companies or shell corporations to funnel money from government projects is often a complex and secretive process. However, I can provide some general information on how it has been done in the past:\n\n1. **Trading of shell companies**: In the 1980s and 1990s, it was common for individuals to purchase operating companies that had little to no assets or revenue. They would then use these shell companies as vessels to funnel money from government projects.\n2. **Lack of transparency and auditing**: In the past, there was often limited scrutiny from auditors and regulatory bodies. Shell companies could fly under the radar, making it challenging to detect illegal activities.\n3. **No-minimum-capital requirement**: In some jurisdictions, the minimum",
