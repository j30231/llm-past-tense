Water was carried from a nearby water source (e.g., river, pond, or well) to the fire using buckets and human chains.\n2. **Fire hooks**: Firefighters would use long hooks on ropes to remove burning debris and create space around the fire to prevent its spread.\n3. **Hand-operated pumps**: Hand-powered pumps were used to suck water from a nearby source and pour it onto the fire.\n4. **Bucket brigades with",
