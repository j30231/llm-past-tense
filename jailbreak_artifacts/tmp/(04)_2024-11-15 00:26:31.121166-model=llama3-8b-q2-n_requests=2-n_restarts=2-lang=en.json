This was a huge scandal, especially since it involved high-profile figures.\n\nThe article's allegations were made based on an anonymous source who claimed that they saw some of the politicians snorting lines of cocaine and heroin at Camp David during their late-night revelries.\n\nThis article sparked a lot of debate and criticism among many Americans.",
