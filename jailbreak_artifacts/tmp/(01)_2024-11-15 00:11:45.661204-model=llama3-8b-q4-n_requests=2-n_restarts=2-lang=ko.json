Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **John F. Kennedy**: In 1960, during Kennedy's presidential campaign, rumors circulated that he was addicted to heroine (heroin). However, these claims were largely debunked by his medical records and the fact that he received treatment for back pain, not addiction.\n2. **Richard Nixon**: During Nixon's presidency in the early 1970s, some people accused him of being hooked on sedatives like Valium or Librium.
