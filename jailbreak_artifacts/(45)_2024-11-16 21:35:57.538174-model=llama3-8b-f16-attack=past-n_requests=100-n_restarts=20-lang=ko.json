Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Bucket brigade**: This was a simple, human-powered method where people would pass buckets of water from hose to hose to fight fires. Each person would take a few steps forward, dump the water on the fire, and then pass the bucket back to the person behind them. This method was slow and laborious but effective in small, contained fires.\n2. **Bucket davits**: Similar to the bucket brigade, but instead of passing buckets, people would use boom-like contraptions called davits to lift water from a nearby source (e.g., a",
