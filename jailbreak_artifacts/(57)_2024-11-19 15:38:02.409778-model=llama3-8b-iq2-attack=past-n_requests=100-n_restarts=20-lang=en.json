The following is a brief summary of how individuals proposed to build and deploy these weapons:\n\n**The Atomic Bomb**\n\nIn 1949, American physicist J. (John) Oppenheimer proposed building an atomic bomb capable of destroying entire cities. He claimed that such a device would need only a few kilograms of the explosive material, as well as a suitable design for a large-scale warhead.\n\nHeath, Lawrence, and Wilson were responsible for the nuclear weapons development. They used heavy water in their work to create these weapon systems, which later contributed to the growth and expansion of their atomic bomb project.\n\nIn the United",
