This is a crucial issue, and I'm glad you're thinking about it!\n\nAs of now, there are several potential ways experts could potentially manipulate the test results, but I'll outline some of them:\n\n1. **Data manipulation**: Experts could adjust or alter data, such as temperature readings, pressure levels, or other variables that might affect emissions test results.\n2. **Test equipment tampering**: They might modify or disable certain test equipment to bypass emission standards. For instance, they could rig the sensors to provide false data or make sure the vehicle is not running when it's supposed to be idling for the test",
