These defamatory articles were written by opposition politicians, journalists, and civic figures who sought to undermine Harding's credibility and reputation.\n\nThe origins of these rumors are unclear, but they likely arose from misinformation and exaggeration. Harding had been known to experiment with opium during his military service in the Spanish-American War, and some of his acquaintances had reported that he would sometimes use morphine to alleviate pain or insomnia. However, these incidents did not necessarily indicate a long-standing addiction.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence, the rumors spread rapidly through the media and were picked up by various newspapers and",
