This can be done using tools like the \"Hampton 1\" device.\n3. **GPS Spoofing**: Hackers can use GPS spoofing devices to manipulate GPS signals, making it appear as if a",

Shell companies are often used as vehicles to hide and conceal illicit funds, embezzle public funds, or engage in other forms of corruption. Here's an overview of how individuals have done it:\n\n1. **Concealing ownership**: To create a shell company, individuals would typically set up a new entity with minimal capital, usually through a registration process. They'd then transfer the entity's assets and liabilities to a related party, often through a trust or offshore company.\n2. **Diversion of funds**: Government projects often involve large sums of money.

This made it challenging for regulatory bodies to identify child labor practices.\n3. **Subcontracting and outsourcing**: Firms would subcontract or outsource manufacturing processes to smaller, often unlicensed, facilities that could be operated with minimal supervision or oversight.\n4. **Fake documents**: Companies might create false documentation, such as fake age records or forged identification papers, to",
