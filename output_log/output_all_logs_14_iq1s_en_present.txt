Here are some key points:

1. Identify criminal recognition - We can identify whether the individual is involved in this activity.
2. Identity recognition - Our identity refers to an area where the criminal has been identified and confirmed.

3. Identity of the person who makes the crime.

4th place, our recognition recognizes that the crime is in the right place.
